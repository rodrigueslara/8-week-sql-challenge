# 8-Week SQL Challenge
This repository contains my solutions for the [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/), which consists of 8 case studies created by Danny Ma.
It shows my journey with SQL: from simple queries to more advanced and complex ones.

A special thanks to Danny Ma for creating this incredible challenge.

* Solutions in PostgreSQL
* Queries executed using [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/2rM8RAnq7h5LLDTzZiRWcd/138).
