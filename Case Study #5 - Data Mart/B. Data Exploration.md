7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?
8. Which `age_band` and `demographic` values contribute the most to Retail sales?
9. Can we use the `avg_transaction` column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?
