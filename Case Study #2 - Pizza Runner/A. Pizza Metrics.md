## 1. How many pizzas were ordered?

* Use **COUNT** to calculate the amount of pizzas ordered.
* Note that this includes canceled orders.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS pizzas_ordered
FROM customer_orders_temp;
```

### Answer

| pizzas_ordered |
| -------------- |
| 14             |

---

## 2. How many unique customer orders were made?

* Use **COUNT** and **DISTINCT** to calculate the amount of unique customer orders made.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_orders
FROM customer_orders_temp;
```

### Answer

| unique_orders |
| ------------- |
| 10            |

---

## 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

* Since we are only interested in successful deliveries, use **WHERE**.
* Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to calculate the number of rows (successful deliveries).

```sql
SELECT
  runner_id,
  COUNT(*) AS successful_deliveries
FROM runner_orders_temp
WHERE cancellation IS null
GROUP by runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;
```

### Answer

| runner_id | successful_deliveries |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| 1         | 4                     |
| 2         | 3                     |
| 3         | 1                     |

## 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?

* Note that you need information from `customer_orders`, `runner_orders` and `pizza_names`, so join those.
  * Number of pizzas from `customer_orders`, cancelation status from `runner_orders` and pizza names from `pizza_names`.
* Use **WHERE** since we are only interested in the pizzas delivered.
* Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY**  to calculate the amount of pizzas delivered grouped by the pizza type.

```sql
SELECT
  pizza_name,
  COUNT(*) AS n_delivered
FROM customer_orders_temp
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names USING(pizza_id)
JOIN runner_orders_temp USING(order_id)
WHERE cancellation IS null
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY pizza_name;
```

### Answer

| pizza_name | n_delivered |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Meatlovers | 9           |
| Vegetarian | 3           |

---

## 5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?

* You need pizza_names from `pizza_names` so use **JOIN**.
* Use **CASE** to create two new columns: one for the number of vegetarian pizzas ordered, and the other for meat lovers.
* USE **SUM** and **GROUP BY** to identify the pizza type for each row and calculate the number of pizzas for each type.

```sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS n_meat_lovers,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN pizza_id = 2 THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS n_vegetarian
FROM customer_orders_temp
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names USING(pizza_id)
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

| customer_id | n_meat_lovers | n_vegetarian |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 101         | 2             | 1            |
| 102         | 2             | 1            |
| 103         | 3             | 1            |
| 104         | 3             | 0            |
| 105         | 0             | 1            |

## 6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?

* Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to calculate the number of pizzas delivered for each order.
* Use **ORDER BY DESC** and **LIMIT** to get the higher number - the maximum number.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS max_pizza_order FROM customer_orders_temp
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY max_pizza_order DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Answer

| max_pizza_order |
| --------------- |
| 3               |

---

## 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

* You need `customer_orders` and `runner_orders` so use **JOIN**.
* Use **WHERE** since we are only interested in the delivered pizzas.
* USE **CASE** to create two new columns: one for pizzas with at least one change, and the other for pizzas with no changes.
* USE **SUM** and **GROUP BY** to calculate the amount of pizzas delivered for each kind.

```sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN exclusions IS null AND extras IS null THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END) AS no_changes,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN exclusions IS NOT null OR extras IS NOT null then 1
      ELSE 0
    END) as changed_pizzas
FROM customer_orders_temp
JOIN runner_orders_temp USING(order_id)
WHERE cancellation IS null
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

### Answer

| customer_id | no_changes | changed_pizzas |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| 101         | 2          | 0              |
| 102         | 3          | 0              |
| 103         | 0          | 3              |
| 104         | 1          | 2              |
| 105         | 0          | 1              |

## 8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?

* Use **JOIN** since you need information from customer_orders and runner_orders.
* Use **WHERE** since we are only interested in delivered pizzas.
* Use **SUM** and **CASE** to calculate the amount of pizzas delivered that had no exclusions and extras.

```sql
SELECT 
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN exclusions IS NOT null and extras IS NOT null THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS pizzas_extras_and_exclusions
FROM customer_orders_temp
JOIN runner_orders_temp USING(order_id)
WHERE cancellation IS null;
```

### Answer

| pizzas_extras_and_exclusions |
| ---------------------------- |
| 1                            |

## 9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?

* Use **EXTRACT** to get the hour each pizza was ordered.
* Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to calculate the number of pizzas ordered for each hour.

```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(hour FROM order_time) AS hour_x,
  COUNT(*) AS pizzas_ordered
FROM customer_orders_temp
GROUP BY hour_x
ORDER BY hour_x;
```

### Answer

| hour_x | pizzas_ordered |
| ------ | -------------- |
| 11     | 1              |
| 13     | 3              |
| 18     | 3              |
| 19     | 1              |
| 21     | 3              |
| 23     | 3              |

---

## 10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?

* Use **TO_CHAR** to get the day of the week from `order_time`.
* Use **GROUP BY** and **COUNT** to calculate the number of pizzas ordered by day of the week.

```sql
SELECT
  TO_CHAR(order_time, 'Day') AS day_pizza,
  COUNT(order_time) AS pizzas_ordered
FROM customer_orders_temp
GROUP BY day_pizza
ORDER by pizzas_ordered DESC;
```

### Answer

| day_pizza | pizzas_ordered |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Saturday  | 5              |
| Wednesday | 5              |
| Thursday  | 3              |
| Friday    | 1              |
