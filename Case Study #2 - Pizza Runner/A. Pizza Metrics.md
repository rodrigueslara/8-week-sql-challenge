## 1. How many pizzas were ordered?

* Use **COUNT** to calculate the amount of pizzas ordered.
* Note that this includes canceled orders.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS pizzas_ordered
FROM customer_orders_temp
```

### Answer

| pizzas_ordered |
| -------------- |
| 14             |

---

## 2. How many unique customer orders were made?

* Use **COUNT** and **DISTINCT** to calculate the amount of unique customer orders made.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_orders
FROM customer_orders_temp
```

### Answer

| unique_orders |
| ------------- |
| 10            |

## 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

* Since we are only interested in successful deliveries, use **WHERE**.
* Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to calculate the number of rows (successful deliveries).

```sql
SELECT
  runner_id,
  COUNT(*) AS successful_deliveries
FROM runner_orders_temp
WHERE cancellation IS null
GROUP by runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id
```

### Answer

| runner_id | successful_deliveries |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| 1         | 4                     |
| 2         | 3                     |
| 3         | 1                     |

## 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?

* Note that you need information from `customer_orders`, `runner_orders` and `pizza_names`, so join those.
  * Number of pizzas from `customer_orders`, cancelation status from `runner_orders` and pizza names from `pizza_names`.
* Use **WHERE** since we are only interested in the pizzas delivered.
* Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY**  to calculate the amount of pizzas delivered grouped by the pizza type.

```sql
SELECT
  pizza_name,
  COUNT(*) AS n_delivered
FROM customer_orders_temp
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names USING(pizza_id)
JOIN runner_orders_temp USING(order_id)
WHERE cancellation IS null
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY pizza_name
```

### Answer

| pizza_name | n_delivered |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Meatlovers | 9           |
| Vegetarian | 3           |

---

# 5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?

* You need pizza_names from `pizza_names` so use **JOIN**.
* Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to calculate the amount of pizzas ordered, grouped by customer and pizza_name.

```sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  pizza_name,
  COUNT(*) AS n_ordered
FROM customer_orders_temp
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names USING(pizza_id)
GROUP BY customer_id, pizza_name
ORDER BY customer_id
```

| customer_id | pizza_name | n_ordered |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 101         | Meatlovers | 2         |
| 101         | Vegetarian | 1         |
| 102         | Meatlovers | 2         |
| 102         | Vegetarian | 1         |
| 103         | Meatlovers | 3         |
| 103         | Vegetarian | 1         |
| 104         | Meatlovers | 3         |
| 105         | Vegetarian | 1         |
