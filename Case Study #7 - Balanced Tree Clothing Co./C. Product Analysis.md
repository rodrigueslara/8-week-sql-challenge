## 1. What are the top 3 products by total revenue before discount?

* Use **SUM** and **GROUP BY** to calculate the total revenue before discount by product.
* Use **ORDER BY** and **LIMIT** to get the top 3.

```sql
SELECT
  product_name,
  SUM(qty * s.price) AS revenue_before_discount
FROM balanced_tree.sales s
JOIN balanced_tree.product_details
  ON product_id = prod_id
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY revenue_before_discount DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### Answer

| product_name                 | revenue_before_discount |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Blue Polo Shirt - Mens       | 217683                  |
| Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens | 209304                  |
| White Tee Shirt - Mens       | 152000                  |

## 2. What is the total quantity, revenue and discount for each segment?

* Use **SUM** and **GROUP BY** to calculate quantity, revenue and discounts.
  * Note: Revenue is total revenue.

```sql
SELECT
  segment_name,
  SUM(qty) AS quantity,
  ROUND(SUM(qty*(100-discount)*s.price::numeric /100),2) AS revenue,
  ROUND(SUM(qty*discount*s.price::numeric/100),2) AS discount
FROM balanced_tree.sales s
JOIN balanced_tree.product_details
  ON product_id = prod_id
GROUP BY segment_name;
```

### Answer

| segment_name | quantity | revenue   | discount |
| ------------ | -------- | --------- | -------- |
| Shirt        | 11265    | 356548.73 | 49594.27 |
| Jeans        | 11349    | 183006.03 | 25343.97 |
| Jacket       | 11385    | 322705.54 | 44277.46 |
| Socks        | 11217    | 270963.56 | 37013.44 |

## 3. What is the top selling product for each segment?

* In `rank_quantity`, use **DENSE_RANK** to identify products by the total quantity sold, partitioned by segment.
* In the outer query, identify the top-selling product by using **WHERE**.

```sql
WITH rank_quantity AS (
  SELECT
    product_name,
    segment_name,
    SUM(qty) AS sold,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY segment_name ORDER BY SUM(qty) DESC) AS rank_qty
  FROM balanced_tree.sales s
  JOIN balanced_tree.product_details
    ON product_id = prod_id
  GROUP BY product_name,segment_name
)

SELECT
  segment_name,
  product_name,
  sold
FROM rank_quantity
WHERE rank_qty = 1;
```

### Answer

| segment_name | product_name                  | sold |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ---- |
| Jacket       | Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens  | 3876 |
| Jeans        | Navy Oversized Jeans - Womens | 3856 |
| Shirt        | Blue Polo Shirt - Mens        | 3819 |
| Socks        | Navy Solid Socks - Mens       | 3792 |

## 4. What is the total quantity, revenue and discount for each category?

* Very similar to question 2.

```sql
SELECT
  category_name,
  SUM(qty) AS quantity,
  ROUND(SUM(qty*(100-discount)*s.price::numeric /100),2) AS revenue,
  ROUND(SUM(qty*discount*s.price::numeric/100),2) AS discount
FROM balanced_tree.sales s
JOIN balanced_tree.product_details
  ON product_id = prod_id
GROUP BY category_name;
```

### Answer

| category_name | quantity | revenue   | discount |
| ------------- | -------- | --------- | -------- |
| Mens          | 22482    | 627512.29 | 86607.71 |
| Womens        | 22734    | 505711.57 | 69621.43 |

## 5. What is the top selling product for each category?

* Very similar to question 3.

```sql
WITH rank_quantity AS (
  SELECT
    product_name,
    category_name,
    SUM(qty) AS sold,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY category_name ORDER BY SUM(qty) DESC) AS rank_qty
  FROM balanced_tree.sales s
  JOIN balanced_tree.product_details
    ON product_id = prod_id
  GROUP BY product_name,category_name
)

SELECT
  category_name,
  product_name,
  sold
FROM rank_quantity
WHERE rank_qty = 1;
```

### Answer

| category_name | product_name                 | sold |

## 6. What is the percentage split of revenue by product for each segment?

* In `revenue_segment`, calculate the total revenue for each segment.
* In the outer query, calculate the percentage split, using the total revenue calculated above.

```sql
WITH revenue_segment AS (
  SELECT
    segment_name,
    SUM(qty*s.price*(100-discount)::numeric/100) AS segment_revenue
  FROM balanced_tree.sales s
  JOIN balanced_tree.product_details
    ON prod_id = product_id 
  GROUP BY segment_name
)

SELECT
  segment_name,
  product_name, 
  ROUND(
    SUM(qty*s.price*(100-discount)::numeric/100)::numeric/segment_revenue*100
  ,2) AS percentage_revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales s
JOIN balanced_tree.product_details
  ON prod_id = product_id
JOIN revenue_segment USING(segment_name)
GROUP BY segment_name, product_name, segment_revenue
ORDER BY segment_name, percentage_revenue DESC;
```

## 7. What is the percentage split of revenue by segment for each category?

* Similar to the previous question.

```sql
WITH revenue_category AS (
  SELECT
    category_name,
    SUM(qty*s.price*(100-discount)::numeric/100) AS category_revenue
  FROM balanced_tree.sales s
  JOIN balanced_tree.product_details
    ON prod_id = product_id 
  GROUP BY category_name
)

SELECT
  category_name,
  segment_name, 
  ROUND(
    SUM(qty*s.price*(100-discount)::numeric/100)::numeric/category_revenue*100
  ,2) AS percentage_revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales s
JOIN balanced_tree.product_details
  ON prod_id = product_id
JOIN revenue_category USING(category_name)
GROUP BY category_name, segment_name, category_revenue
ORDER BY category_name, percentage_revenue DESC;
```

### Answer

| category_name | segment_name | percentage_revenue |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Mens          | Shirt        | 56.82              |
| Mens          | Socks        | 43.18              |

## 8. What is the percentage split of total revenue by category?

* The percentage is calculated by: taking the revenue of each category (using **SUM** and**GROUP BY**), dividing by the total revenue (calculated in the subquery - `SELECT SUM(qty*price*(100-discount)::numeric/100) FROM balanced_tree.sales`) and multiplying by 100.

```sql
SELECT
  category_name,
  ROUND(
    SUM(
      qty*s.price*(100-discount)::numeric/100
    )::numeric
    /(SELECT SUM(qty*price*(100-discount)::numeric/100) FROM balanced_tree.sales)
    *100
  ,2) AS percentage_revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales s
JOIN balanced_tree.product_details
  ON prod_id = product_id
GROUP BY category_name;
```

### Answer

| category_name | percentage_revenue |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Mens          | 55.37              |
| Womens        | 44.63              |

## 9. What is the total transaction ‚Äúpenetration‚Äù for each product? (hint: penetration = number of transactions where at least 1 quantity of a product was purchased divided by total number of transactions)

* Number of transactions where at least 1 quantity of a product was purchased - `COUNT(qty)`
* Divided by total number of transactions `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) FROM balanced_tree.sales`

```sql
SELECT
  product_name,
  ROUND(COUNT(qty)::numeric/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) FROM balanced_tree.sales)*100,2) AS penetration
FROM balanced_tree.sales s
JOIN balanced_tree.product_details
  ON prod_id = product_id
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY penetration DESC;
```

### Answer

| product_name                     | penetration |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Navy Solid Socks - Mens          | 51.24       |
| Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens     | 51.00       |
| Navy Oversized Jeans - Womens    | 50.96       |

## 10. What is the most common combination of at least 1 quantity of any 3 products in a 1 single transaction?

* In `cte_txn`, create a column with products bought in each transaction using **STRING_AGG**.
* Additionally, use **COUNT** to get the number of distinct products bought in each transaction.
* In `combinations`, first use **WHERE** to select transactions with 3 distinct products and then use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to count the number of times each combination was bought.
* In the outer query, use **WHERE** to select the most common combinations.

```sql
WITH cte_txn AS (
  SELECT
    txn_id,
    STRING_AGG(product_name,', ' ORDER BY product_name) AS products,
    COUNT(product_name) AS quantity
  FROM balanced_tree.sales s
  JOIN balanced_tree.product_details
    ON prod_id = product_id
  GROUP BY txn_id
),

combinations AS (
  SELECT
    products,
    COUNT(products) AS combination_sold
  FROM cte_txn
  WHERE quantity = 3
  GROUP BY products
)

SELECT
  *
FROM combinations
WHERE combination_sold =
  (SELECT
    MAX(combination_sold)
  FROM combinations);
```

### Answer

| products                                                                                  | combination_sold |
