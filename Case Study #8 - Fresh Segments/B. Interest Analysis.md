## Interest Analysis

1. Which interests have been present in all `month_year` dates in our dataset?
2. Using this same `total_months` measure - calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which `total_months` value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?
3. If we were to remove all `interest_id` values which are lower than the `total_months` value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?
4. Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed `interest` example for your arguments - think about what it means to have less months present from a segment perspective.
5. After removing these interests - how many unique interests are there for each month?
