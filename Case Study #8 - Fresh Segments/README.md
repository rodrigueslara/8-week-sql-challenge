## Introduction

Danny created Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyse trends in online ad click behaviour for their unique customer base.

Clients share their customer lists with the Fresh Segments team who then aggregate interest metrics and generate a single dataset worth of metrics for further analysis.

In particular - the composition and rankings for different interests are provided for each client showing the proportion of their customer list who interacted with online assets related to each interest for each month.

Danny has asked for your assistance to analyse aggregated metrics for an example client and provide some high level insights about the customer list and their interests.

## Available Data

For this case study there is a total of 2 datasets which you will need to use to solve the questions.

### Interest Metrics

This table contains information about aggregated interest metrics for a specific major client of Fresh Segments which makes up a large proportion of their customer base.

Each record in this table represents the performance of a specific `interest_id` based on the client’s customer base interest measured through clicks and interactions with specific targeted advertising content.

Here are the first 10 rows:

| _month | _year | month_year | interest_id | composition | index_value | ranking | percentile_ranking |
| ------ | ----- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 32486       | 11.89       | 6.19        | 1       | 99.86              |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 6106        | 9.93        | 5.31        | 2       | 99.73              |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 18923       | 10.85       | 5.29        | 3       | 99.59              |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 6344        | 10.32       | 5.1         | 4       | 99.45              |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 100         | 10.77       | 5.04        | 5       | 99.31              |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 69          | 10.82       | 5.03        | 6       | 99.18              |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 79          | 11.21       | 4.97        | 7       | 99.04              |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 6111        | 10.71       | 4.83        | 8       | 98.9               |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 6214        | 9.71        | 4.83        | 8       | 98.9               |
| 7      | 2018  | 07-2018    | 19422       | 10.11       | 4.81        | 10      | 98.63              |

Let’s interpret the first row together.

In July 2018, the `composition` metric is 11.89, meaning that 11.89% of the client’s customer list interacted with the interest `interest_id = 32486` - we can link `interest_id` to a separate mapping table to find the segment name called “Vacation Rental Accommodation Researchers”

The `index_value` is 6.19, means that the `composition` value is 6.19x the average composition value for all Fresh Segments clients’ customer for this particular interest in the month of July 2018.

The `ranking` and `percentage_ranking` relates to the order of `index_value` records in each month year.

### Interest Map

This mapping table links the `interest_id` with their relevant interest information. You will need to join this table onto the previous `interest_details` table to obtain the `interest_name` as well as any details about the summary information.

| id  | interest_name             | interest_summary                                                                   | created_at               | last_modified            |
