## 1. How many users are there?

* Use **COUNT** and **DISTINCT** to count the number of users.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS count_users
FROM clique_bait.users;
```

### Answer

| count |
| ----- |
| 500   |

## 2. How many cookies does each user have on average?

* In cte_user, count the number of cookis per person.
* In the outer query, calculate the average.

```sql
WITH cte_user AS (
  SELECT user_id,
  COUNT(user_id) AS count_cookies
FROM clique_bait.users
GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT
  ROUND(AVG(count_cookies),2) AS avg_cookies
FROM cte_user;
```

### Answer

| avg_cookies |
| ----------- |
| 3.56        |

## 3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?

* Use **TO_CHAR** to get the month.
* Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to calculate the number of unique visits grouped by month.
  
```sql
SELECT
  TO_CHAR(event_time, 'MM') AS month_number,
  TO_CHAR(event_time, 'Month') AS month_visit,
  COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) AS unique_visits
FROM clique_bait.events
GROUP BY month_visit, month_number
ORDER BY month_number;
```

### Answer

| month_number | month_visit | unique_visits |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| 01           | January     | 876           |
| 02           | February    | 1488          |
| 03           | March       | 916           |
| 04           | April       | 248           |
| 05           | May         | 36            |

## 4. What is the number of events for each event type?

* To get the event name, **JOIN** `event_identifier`.
* Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to calculate the number of events grouped by event type.

```sql
SELECT
  event_name,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM clique_bait.events
JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier USING(event_type)
GROUP BY event_name
ORDER BY event_count DESC;
```

### Answer

| event_name    | event_count |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Page View     | 20928       |
| Add to Cart   | 8451        |
| Purchase      | 1777        |
| Ad Impression | 876         |
| Ad Click      | 702         |

## 5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?

* Use **WHERE** since we are only interested in `Purchase` events.
* Use **COUNT** and calculate the percentage of visits that have a purchase event.

```sql
SELECT
  ROUND(
    COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id)::numeric /
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) FROM clique_bait.events)
    * 100
  ,2) AS percentage_purchase
FROM clique_bait.events
JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier USING(event_type)
WHERE event_name = 'Purchase';
```

### Answer

| percentage_purchase |
| ------------------- |
| 49.86               |

---

## 6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?

* This percentage is calculated by counting the number of visits where the checkout page was viewed but there is not a purchase event, and dividing that by the total number of visits.
* To count the first, we'll look at the events and hierarchy tables: note that what we want is to count visits where `page_id` 12 appears, but 13 doesn't.
* In `visit`, we get the max value for `page_id` grouped by `visit_id`. The number of visits where the checkout page was viewed but not the purchase page is the number of rows where the max is 12 (checkout).
* In the outer query, calculate the percentage.

```sql
WITH visit AS (
  SELECT
    visit_id,
    MAX(page_id) AS max_page
  FROM clique_bait.events
  GROUP BY visit_id
  ORDER BY visit_id
)

SELECT
  ROUND(
    COUNT(max_page)::numeric/
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) FROM clique_bait.events)
    *100
  ,2) AS percentage_view_no_purchase
FROM visit
WHERE max_page = 12;
```

### Answer

| percentage_view_no_purchase |
| --------------------------- |
| 9.15                        |

## 7. What are the top 3 pages by number of views?

* Use **WHERE** to get only the views event.
* Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to calculate the number of views grouped by page.
* Use **ORDER BY** and **LIMIT** to get the top 3.

```sql
SELECT
  page_name,
  COUNT(page_id) AS page_views
FROM clique_bait.events
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy USING(page_id)
WHERE event_type = 1
GROUP BY page_name
ORDER BY page_views DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### Answer

| page_name    | page_views |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| All Products | 3174       |
| Checkout     | 2103       |
| Home Page    | 1782       |

## 8. What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?

* In `view_product`, calculate the number of views for each product category.
* In `cart_product`, calculate the number of cart additions.
* In the outer query, join both tables.
 
```sql
WITH view_product AS (
  SELECT
    product_category,
    COUNT(page_name) AS view_count
  FROM clique_bait.events
  JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy USING(page_id)
  WHERE event_type = 1
  GROUP BY product_category
),

cart_product AS (
  SELECT
    product_category,
    COUNT(page_name) AS cart_count
  FROM clique_bait.events
  JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy USING(page_id)
  WHERE event_type = 2
  GROUP BY product_category
)

SELECT
  product_category,
  view_count,
  cart_count
FROM view_product
JOIN cart_product USING(product_category)
ORDER BY product_category;
```

### Answer

| product_category | view_count | cart_count |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Fish             | 4633       | 2789       |
| Luxury           | 3032       | 1870       |
| Shellfish        | 6204       | 3792       |

## 9. What are the top 3 products by purchases?

* In `purchase_cte`, get all `visit_id`'s where purchases are made.
* In the outer query, use **WHERE** to get rows where purchases are made and **SELECT** the page name when the product is added to the cart.
* Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to count the number of purchases by product.
* Use **ORDER BY** and **LIMIT** to get the top 3.

```sql
WITH purchases_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    DISTINCT visit_id
  FROM clique_bait.events
  WHERE page_id = 13 
)

SELECT 
  page_name,
  COUNT(
    CASE
      WHEN event_type = 2 THEN visit_id
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS purchase_count
FROM clique_bait.events
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy USING(page_id)
WHERE visit_id IN (SELECT * FROM purchases_cte) AND event_type = 2
GROUP BY page_name
ORDER BY purchase_count DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### Answer

| page_name | purchase_count |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Lobster   | 754            |
| Oyster    | 726            |
| Crab      | 719            |
