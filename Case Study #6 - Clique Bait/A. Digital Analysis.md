## 2. How many cookies does each user have on average?

* In cte_user, count the number of cookis per person.
* In the outer query, calculate the average.

```sql
WITH cte_user AS (
  SELECT user_id,
  COUNT(user_id) AS count_cookies
FROM clique_bait.users
GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT
  ROUND(AVG(count_cookies),2) AS avg_cookies
FROM cte_user;
```

### Answer

| avg_cookies |
| ----------- |
| 3.56        |

## 3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?

* Use **TO_CHAR** to get the month.
* Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to calculate the number of unique visits grouped by month.
  
```sql
SELECT
  TO_CHAR(event_time, 'MM') AS month_number,
  TO_CHAR(event_time, 'Month') AS month_visit,
  COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) AS unique_visits
FROM clique_bait.events
GROUP BY month_visit, month_number
ORDER BY month_number
```

### Answer

| month_number | month_visit | unique_visits |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| 01           | January     | 876           |
| 02           | February    | 1488          |
| 03           | March       | 916           |
| 04           | April       | 248           |

## 4. What is the number of events for each event type?

* To get the event name, **JOIN** `event_identifier`.
* Use **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to calculate the number of events grouped by event type.

```sql
SELECT
  event_name,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM clique_bait.events
JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier USING(event_type)
GROUP BY event_name
ORDER BY event_count DESC
```

### Answer

| event_name    | event_count |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Page View     | 20928       |
| Add to Cart   | 8451        |
| Purchase      | 1777        |
| Ad Impression | 876         |
| Ad Click      | 702         |

## 5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?

* Use **WHERE** since we are only interested in `Purchase` events.
* Use **COUNT** and calculate the percentage of visits that have a purchase event.

```sql
SELECT
  ROUND(
    COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id)::numeric /
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) FROM clique_bait.events)
    * 100
  ,2) AS percentage_purchase
FROM clique_bait.events
JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier USING(event_type)
WHERE event_name = 'Purchase'
```

### Answer

| percentage_purchase |
| ------------------- |
| 49.86               |

## 6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?
