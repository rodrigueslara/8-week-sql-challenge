## Campaigns Analysis 

Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:

* user_id
* visit_id
* visit_start_time: the earliest event_time for each visit
* page_views: count of page views for each visit
* cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit
* purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
* campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
* impression: count of ad impressions for each visit
* click: count of ad clicks for each visit
* (Optional column) cart_products: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)

### Answer

```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  visit_id,
  MIN(event_time) AS visit_start_time,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN event_type = 1 THEN 1
      ELSE 0 END
  ) AS page_views,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN event_type = 2 THEN 1
      ELSE 0 END
  ) AS cart_adds,
  SUM(
    CASE WHEN event_type = 3 THEN 1
    ELSE 0 END
  ) AS purchase,
  campaign_name,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN event_type = 4 THEN 1
      ELSE 0 END
  ) AS impression,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN event_type = 5 THEN 1
      ELSE 0 END
  ) AS click,
  STRING_AGG(
    CASE WHEN event_type = 2 THEN page_name END, ', ' ORDER BY sequence_number
  ) AS cart_products
FROM clique_bait.events
JOIN clique_bait.users USING(cookie_id)
JOIN clique_bait.campaign_identifier
  ON event_time BETWEEN clique_bait.campaign_identifier.start_date AND clique_bait.campaign_identifier.end_date
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy USING(page_id)	 
GROUP BY user_id, visit_id, campaign_name
ORDER BY user_id, visit_start_time;
```
