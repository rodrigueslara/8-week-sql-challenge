Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

By running:

```sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  start_date,
  plan_name
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
JOIN foodie_fi.plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE customer_id IN (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19)
ORDER BY customer_id, start_date
```

We get:

| customer_id | start_date               | plan_name     |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| 1           | 2020-08-01T00:00:00.000Z | trial         |
